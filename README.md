Hobb API Server: backend for the Rebus Reader system

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RebusFoundation/reader-api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RebusFoundation/reader-api)

## Starting the Server

To start the regular server: `npm start`

To start the dev-server (which uses `nodemon` to automatically restart): `npm run dev-server`

## Starting Tests

Unit tests can be run with `npm run test-unit`
Test for the database models can be run with `npm run test-models`
Integration test for the routes can be run with `npm run test-integration`

`npm run test` will run all three sets of tests

`npm run lint` will run eslint (only select rules are applied) and check flow types

## Interface

### Authorization

The server uses [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) for authorization, with [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
tokens. The JWT tokens should use the same secret value as defined by the
`SECRETORKEY` configuration variable (see below). It should also use the
audience and issuer defined by `AUDIENCE` and `ISSUER`.

Tokens are passed to the server as [bearer tokens](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens/).
A typical example:

```
GET /924WWrqtc2dbZMF2NQRiHp/library HTTP/1.1
Host: api.rebus.foundation
Date: Fri, 19 Oct 2018 16:25:55 GMT
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

...where `<token>` is the JWT token.

Typically only the owner of a resource can access a resource.

#### Errors

Requests without a JWT token will fail with a 401 status code.

Requests with a valid JWT token for access to another user's resources will fail
with a 403 status code.

### Representation

The server follows the [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/) API.
All objects are represented as [Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/)
[JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/).

### Documentation

The documentation for the routes is available at: https://rebusfoundation.github.io/reader-api

Note for developers: inline swagger documentation should be updated whenever you make changes to the routes
The hosted documentation will be updated automatically once a pull request is merged on master

### Activity types

The server can handle the following activity types.

#### Create Publication

To upload a publication, use an activity with type `Create` and object type
`Publication`. The publication should include all of its `Document`
members by value, with their full content.

#### Read Document

To note that a user has read a document, use an activity with type `Read` and
object type `Document`.

## Administration

### Configuration variables

The server uses environment variables for configuration.

* `AUDIENCE`: The expected audience for [JWT](https://jwt.io) tokens.
* `DEPLOY_STAGE`: Deployment stage. One of `production`, `staging`, or `development`.
* `DEV_PASSWORD`: A basic auth password used when in development or staging.
  Username is `admin`.
* `DOMAIN`: Domain name of the server. If the server is hit with HTTP, redirects
  to https: plus this domain.
* `ISSUER`: Expected issuer for JWT tokens.
* `NODE_ENV`: Environment variable used by [express](https://expressjs.com/).
  Can be `production` or `development`.
* `SECRETORKEY`: Expected shared secret for [JWT](https://jwt.io) tokens.
* `POSTGRE_INSTANCE`: the db server. Set it to 'localhost' for a local dev. If this
  variable is not set, the models will be stored in a SQLite database.
* `POSTGRE_DB`: the name of the database.
* `POSTGRE_USER`: the user name to use for the connection
* `POSTGRE_PASSWORD`: the password
* `SQLITE_DB`: filename of the SQLite database to store data if `POSTGRE_INSTANCE` is
  not set. Defaults to "./dev.sqlite3".

The environment variables can be set in a .env file

### Commit Message Style

`prefix: message`

Where prefix can be any of: build, ci, chore, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test.

The other rules are as
[described here](https://github.com/marionebl/commitlint/tree/master/@commitlint/config-conventional)

### JS style

Code should be written in the [Standard]() style and even if it isn't,
`prettier-standard` is run on commit to convert the code into Standard style.

(I don't particularly prefer Standard style over any other variety, but we need
a coding style and that one's as good as any other and comes with a bunch of
ready-made tools.)
